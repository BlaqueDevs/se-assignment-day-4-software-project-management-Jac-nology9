      Gantt charts that help to track progress and identify delays.
     
## 2. How does effective cost control contribute to the success of a software project? What strategies can be used to prevent budget overruns?
      Effective cost control ensures a project stays within budget. Strategies like developing budgets and monitoring costs regularly.
       
## 3. Compare and contrast Agile and Waterfall methodologies. What are the main advantages and disadvantages of each?
      Agile is an iterative and incremental approach to project management and software development. Waterfall uses a linear and sequential approach.
      Agile offers quick response to changes but offers less predictability.
      Waterfall is easy to manage due to its rigidity but it is difficult to accommodate changes.
      
## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
      Agile is more beneficial in projects needing flexibility, example app development. 
      Waterfall is more beneficial in projects with clear requirements, example construction of buildings.
      
## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
      Methods include: code reviews, automated testing, and continuous integration. 
      High standards ensures reliability and the of customer expectations.

## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
      The project scope helps to set clear goals and expectations.

## 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?
      A detailed project schedule offers a detailed timeline with milestones which helps allocate resources effectively. 
      Gantt charts provide a visual timeline, making task tracking and dependencies clearer.

## 8. What are the core issues that your software aims to address? Why are these problems significant to your target audience?
      My software addresses access to timely medical advice and secure access to health records. 
      These problems are significant for users needing convenient, reliable health services.
      
## 9. How can clearly defining the problem help in developing a more effective software solution?
      Defining the problem clearly helps create focused, relevant features, ensuring the software addresses user needs effectively.

## 10. How would you describe your software solution in a way that captures its essence without diving into technical details?
       The software provides convenient access to doctors and medical records through an easy-to-use web platform, offering users a seamless healthcare experience.
       
## 11. What are the main features or functionalities that make your software stand out?
       Key features include video conferencing with doctors and secure access to medical records, making it unique in telemedicine for the Ugandan community.

## 12. What data is available regarding the market size and growth potential for your software?
       The Ugandan healthcare market is growing due to increasing internet access and digital transformation, creating demand for telemedicine solutions.
       
## 13. How can understanding market trends inform your softwareâ€™s positioning and development?
       Understanding market trends helps position the software by identifying gaps in the market, such as the growing demand for remote healthcare services.
